Start an RStudio Quarto project titled `p1`. Place it inside a folder named `BIOSTAT620_pset_sol`.\n\nYou will have two different types of `.qmd` files in this project: code files and an answer sheet. The code files will be used to run code for this assignment. The answer sheet will not run code, but you will input your answers to various questions.\n\nStart a Quarto document called `beginning.qmd` (code file). This file will be used to run code for problems 3-4. We recommend you edit in source mode rather than visual.\n\nAlso copy this file `pset-01-unix-quarto.qmd` (answer sheet) and move it to the `p1` directory. You will input some answers and code lines to this file.\n\n2.  (1 point) Create a directory called `img` and save a screen shot of your RStudio session for the project (titled img_2). Include your screenshot in the Quarto document.\n\n3.  (1 point) Next, in your `beginning.qmd` Quarto document, define variables $a=1, b=-1, c=-2$ and print out the solutions to $f(x) = ax^2+bx+c=0$. Solving the equation with the quadratic formula, do not report complex solutions, only real numbers.\n\n4.  (1 point) Include in `beginning.qmd` a graph of $f(x)$ versus $x$ for $x \\in (-5,5)$.\n\n```{r}\nx <- seq(-5, 5, length = 100)\n```\n\nAlso include the x-axis (hint: use the `lines` function immediately after the `plot` function).\n\n5.  (1 point) Create a directory called `docs`. Use the command `quarto render` to create a PDF and save it to the `docs` directory. Show us the command you typed:\n\n```         \nmkdir docs\n```\n\n6.  (1 point) Use Unix to create a directory called `data` in the project home directory. Include the Unix command you used to create the directory. Also create a `results` directory in the home directory.\n\n```         \n# Your code here\n```\n\n7.  (1 point) Use a terminal-based text editor to create a file `coefs1.txt` in the `data` directory and save three coefficients, `1 -1 -2` for example. Show us the Unix commands you used to achieve this:\n\n```         \n# Your code here\n```\n\n8.  (1 point) Make a directory called `code`. Use Unix to copy the file `beginning.qmd` to a file called `quadratic.qmd` in the code directory. Show us the Unix commands you used.\n\n```         \n# Your code here\n```\n\n9.  (2 points) Edit the `quadratic.qmd` file to read in `a`, `b`, and `c` from the file `coefs.txt`. Make sure to use a relative path when reading the file. As before, print out the solutions to $f(x) = ax^2+bx+c=0$. Do not report complex solutions or duplicates, only real numbers. If no real solutions exist, output \"no real solutions\".\n\nTest your code on 3 different examples: `coefs1.txt` as above, `coefs2.txt` (a = -1, b = 2, c = -1), and `coefs3.txt` (a = -1, b = 1, c = -1) (note: you should create these files in `data`). In addition to printing, save the solutions in `results/results{n}.txt` as n ranges from 1 to 3. Hint: Generalize `solve_quadratic` as a function and run a for loop over the indices 1, 2, and 3.\n\n10. (1 point) Change the path of the file you are reading to the full path you get when you type `file.path(getwd(), \"data/coefs.txt\")`. Confirm that the file still renders. Then move the entire `p1` project to a directory called `RtmpyDknq4`. Does the file render? Change the path back to a relative path and see if it renders. Move your file back to the original directory when you are done.\n\n```         \n# Your code here\n```\n\n11. Navigate to `BIOSTAT620_pset_sol` in Terminal using `cd`. Create a git instance by using:\n\n```         \ngit init\n```\n\nAdd all files using:\n\n```         \ngit add .\n```\n\nCheck the status using:\n\n```         \ngit status\n```\n\nCommit the files using:\n\n```         \ngit commit -m \"pset1\"\n```\n\nCreate a new **private** repository on Github titled `BIOSTAT620_pset_sol` by clicking the **New** button and following instructions. On your local machine, add the Github remote url:\n\n```         \ngit remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/BIOSTAT620_pset_sol.git\n```\n\nPush your commit to Github using:\n\n```         \ngit push origin main\n```\n\nGo to Github and check that your code has been added.
